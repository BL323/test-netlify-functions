# Netlify Functions Playground

Playing around with Netlify serverless functions. Netlify functions are underpinned by AWS Lambda functions as a service.

Functions: 
- hello.js, basic starter example.
- greet.js, environment variable usage.
- weather.js, simple external [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) request with npm dependencies. Secret API key is loaded as an environment variable.
